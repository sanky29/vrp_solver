## Description
We were supposed to build a simple software for grocery delivery managment which boils down to Capacitized Vehicle Routing Problem([CVRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem))..
So we took two approches for problem. One was to solve CVRP instance exactly using [Integer Linear Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming) and other was to use hurestice approch 
mainly [Construction Hurestic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_heuristic). The detailed implementation can be found here<br \>
